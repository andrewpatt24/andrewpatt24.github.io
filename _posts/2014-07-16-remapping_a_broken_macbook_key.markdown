I recently started using an old macbook, cleaning out the whole hard drive and re-installing Mavericks OS-X on it. The problem was it had a broken zero key. At first I thought I could deal with it, but I didn't get to the second line of some new code before I realised the biggest problem: No closing bracket. Damn it.

After a bit of googling I found a great app on the app store, called <a title="Karabiner" href="https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/" target="_blank">Karabiner</a>Â (formally KeyRemap4Macbook). Along with a number of drop-down lists, you can edit an xml to change just about anything you like on the keyboard. I would recommend it for anyone trying to change anything on their keyboard, as the app gives limitless possibilities if your happy to spend the time learning its xml.

Below is the script I used to remap CTRL+9 to 0 - and SHIFT+CTRL+9 to ")"

Theres not much to it but I felt quite happy once i'd worked out how to use it. Lets just hope I don't need what CTRL+9 actually gives...
