Welcome to the new site!

This is just a quick note to say I've now moved!

I've moved over from my original blog site www.dinnerwithdata.com onto github pages [andrewpatt24.github.io](http://andrewpatt24.github.io). Unfortunately I'm no longer going to be using wordpress which comes with its positive points, but with github pages it means I can have greater control of the site and use google analytics for tracking instead!

Anyone coming to the old site will now be re-directed.

Thanks to [Pannos Sakkos](https://github.com/PanosSakkos) for the Jekyll theme - linked [here](http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/personal/).

Enjoy!
