## About

Hi and welcome to my website! I'm a Data Scientist currently at Naturalmotion games working on building smarter, data driven games and internal products. My focus is on solving complex problems and front-end visualisations to help product and tech teams understand their users.

In my spare time, I work on kaggle and hackerrank problems in python and keep up to date with everything I can in the data science community, regurlarly attending community meetups such as PyData.

Aside from the geeky stuff, I'm a keen sports nut, particularly Rugby, Lacrosse and Golf.
